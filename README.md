# win95-web
An implementation of Microsoft's Windows 95 on the web.<br>
Although I will integrate this project into my website in the future, it is available standalone on https://hallo89.github.io/win95-web/.

The early file history is not available since I only moved this project to Git as its scale grew larger.

Please note that I am not affiliated with Microsoft or its Windows 95 product in any way - this is just a hobby project for fun.

# win95-web
An implementation of Microsoft's Windows 95 on the web.<br>
While I work on integrating this project into my official website, it will not be available on a website yet (the code works tho, if you want to try it).

The early file history is not available since I only moved this project to Git as its scale grew larger.

Please note that I am not affiliated with Microsoft or its Windows 95 product in any way - this is just a hobby project for fun.
